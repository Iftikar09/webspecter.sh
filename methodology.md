# WebSpecter Methodology

WebSpecter is not a scanner.

It is a **decision-support framework**.

---

## Core Principles
- Evidence before payloads
- Manual confirmation over automation
- Chains over single bugs

---

## Recommended Workflow

1. Run WebSpecter recon
2. Review signals & assumptions
3. Apply negative testing
4. Brainstorm exploit chains
5. Decide submit vs wait
6. Write clean report

---

## Analyst Rule

> If the backend trusts you when it shouldn’t — it’s real.

---

## Why This Works

Scanners miss logic.

Humans catch logic — **when guided correctly**.
